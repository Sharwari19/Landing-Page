# Landing-Page

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum. I built the Holy Grail website layout from scratch using my knowledge of the basics of HTML and CSS.

## Project Description

The Holy Grail layout is a classic web design challenge that involves creating a webpage with the following layout:

* A header that spans the full width of the page
* A footer that spans the full width of the page
* A main content area in the center
* A sidebar on the left
* A sidebar on the right

This website was designed based on a reference image provided and a few details about fonts and colors.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Features

* Responsive design
* Semantic HTML5 markup
